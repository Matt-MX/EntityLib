Block Bench addon for EntityLib

Gives complete support of making block bench bedrock compatible models in EntityLib, with animations.
This is a direct port of the WorldSeedEntityEngine made by my good pal iam https://github.com/AtlasEngineCa/WorldSeedEntityEngine/blob/master. Permission was granted to port this repository to EntityLib by iam himself.
